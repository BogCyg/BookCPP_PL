Please note that it is recommended to use Xcode 11 or newer to run this code.
Xcode project can be generated by CMake using following command from within build_mac folder:
cmake -G "Xcode" ..

Although Apple's compiler name clang is mostly compatible with C++17, 
there are some things left out as of now (macOS 10.15, Xcode 11.1). 
Other compilers, like gcc, can be installed using 3rd party package 
managers such as Homebrew (https://brew.sh) or MacPorts (https://www.macports.org).
